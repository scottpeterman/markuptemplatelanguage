# Markup Template Langage (MTL)
MTL provides a simple markup syntax for extracting data from semi-structured text data typically produces by various network vendors. mtl.py produces json data for network automation processing, and is particularly useful in Robotframework. This is not as powerful as other libraries such as textFSM, but grew from my frustration with regex. It is much easier, and templates are easy to share with others. It still needs work but has definate use cases right now.

## mtlRender.py
mtlRender is a pyQt5 based gui tool for testing your templates and cli output. Again, a little rough, but very userful. tfsmRender2.py is a similar tool for textFSM, and show's a beter way to get TextFSM to produce json instead of lists of lists for a data structure. util.py is a wrapper for many useful functions when interacting with network cli's and even some ncclient wrapped functionality for netconf, and a restconf client in its VERY early stages.

## Methods supported
* MID - searching for item with leading and trailing strings
* BOL - search for item with trailing, but no leading string
* EOL - search for item with leading, but no training string
> Key Concept â€“ match the data around what you're looking for... What's in between is what you need.
## Sample output from mtl
```javascript
{
  "test1": {
    "totaloutputdrops": "0",
    "macaddress": "d46d.503b.6913",
    "internetaddress": "Unknown",
    "description": "SW1_Eth1/37",
    "MTU": "9202",
    "drops": "3648686",
    "inputerrors": "5279"
  }
}
```

## Example Usage
```python
from mtl import rendorValidator
data = renderValidator(template,sourceclioutput,"test1")
print(data)
```
## Sample Template
```python
[[fieldbegin='macaddress', method=MID, match=', address is ']]@[[fieldend='macaddress', match='(bia']]
[[fieldbegin='MTU', method=MID, match='MTU ']]@[[fieldend='MTU', match='bytes, BW']]
[[fieldbegin='inputerrors', method=BOL]]@[[fieldend='inputerrors', match=' input errors']]
[[fieldbegin='description', method=EOL, match='Description: ']]@[[fieldend='description', match=' \n']]
[[fieldbegin='internetaddress', method=EOL, match='Internet address is ']]@[[fieldend='internetaddress', match=' \n']]
[[fieldbegin='drops', method=BOL]]@[[fieldend='drops', match='drops for unrecognized']]
[[fieldbegin='totaloutputdrops', method=MID, match='bytes, ']]@[[fieldend='totaloutputdrops', match='total output drops']]
```
