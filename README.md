# Markup Template Langage (MTL)
MTL is a simple markup syntax for extracting data from semi-structured text data typically produces by various network vendors. mtl.py produces json data for network automation processing

## Methods supported
* MID searching for item with leading and trailing strings
* BOL search for item with trailing, but no leading string
* EOL search for item with leading, but no training string
> Key Concept â€“ match the data around what you're looking for... What's in between is what you need.
###Sample output from mtl
```javascript
{
  "test1": {
    "totaloutputdrops": "0",
    "macaddress": "d46d.503b.6913",
    "internetaddress": "Unknown",
    "description": "SW1_Eth1/37",
    "MTU": "9202",
    "drops": "3648686",
    "inputerrors": "5279"
  }
}```
